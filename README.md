The project aims to improve the powerlifting competition experience for lifters without an experienced coach using lifting cast.

The goal is to provide a less experienced competitor or coach handling many athletes with the tools to make better decisions in the minutes they are allowed to declare an attempt
The data is readily available on lifting cast, but without the help of a handler or while tracking multiple athletes, this information can be overwhelming 

                        planning to implement
- only showing the competitions which are being held on the day
- being allowed to select multiple athletes to manage a team
- Display athlete ranking as the competition progresses (dots, pl points, total)
- displaying team ranking as competition progresses (dops, pl points)
-
